# ProgrammingAssignment4
This repository contains the implementation for Programming Assignment 4 (Clustering Analysis). The project focuses on clustering image data using deep feature representations extracted from a pretrained ResNet18 convolutional neural network, followed by dimensionality reduction and classical clustering algorithms.
